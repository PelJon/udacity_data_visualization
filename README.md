The repository for my final submission in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

# Summary

**Dataset:**
Baseball Data

**Reasoning:**		
I want to explore if there is any correlation between home runs, batting averages and the handedness, weight or height of a player.

**Data Story:**
The reader of the visualization which will be a viewer-driven narrative. The reader sees a scatterplot which shows the correlation between height and batting average. Through interactive buttons the reader can choose also between other factors like weight and home runs.
